## How you can contribute

### Bug reports

When you think you might've experienced a bug, first search through the [issues](https://github.com/GoogleFeud/objvl/issues) to see if it has already been reported, if it hasn't, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/ts-docs/ts-docs/issues) which describes the bug in detail. Do not be afraid to give as much information as possible, and make sure to provide an example which replicates the bug in question.

- Make sure the name of your issue is clear and descriptive, avoid one-word issue names.
- Add the options you ran ts-docs with.


### Suggestions

If you have a suggestion, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/GoogleFeud/objvl/issues) describing the suggestion and the problems / issues it'll 
resolve. 

### Pull requests

If you'd like to help out and contribute on fixing an issue or adding a new feature, create a pull request! Before you create a pull request, please create an
issue to discuss it (if there isn't one already, or your pull request doesn't fix an existing issue).

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make your changes.
3. Make sure to lint the code using eslint!
4. Submit a pull request!

If the branch you're working on has changed since you created the pull request, you will need to update your fork by running `git pull`.
